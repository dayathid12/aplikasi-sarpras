# TODO: Fix Livewire Multiple Root Elements Error

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Identified the issue: The page was using a custom view with @livewire, causing multiple root elements since the page itself is a Livewire component.
- [x] Changed the page view to use the Livewire component's view directly to avoid nesting.
- [x] Started the Laravel server to test the fix.

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the Livewire component on the list page to confirm the error is resolved.
- [ ] Verify that the calendar functionality works as expected.
